        st.markdown(""" The Loan Amount Approval dataset contains information about loan applications and whether they were approved or not. It provides insights into the factors that influence the approval or rejection of loan applications. Here is a description of the typical fields you may find in such a dataset:

    #### Applicant Information: 
    This section includes data about the loan applicants, such as their demographic information, including age, gender, marital status, and employment details like occupation, income, and employment history.

    Loan Details:
    This section includes information about the loan applied for, such as the loan amount requested, the purpose of the loan (e.g., home purchase, business investment, education), the desired loan term, and the type of loan (e.g., personal loan, mortgage, car loan).

    #### Credit History: 
    Credit history information provides insights into the applicant's past credit behavior and includes data such as credit scores, credit utilization ratio, outstanding debts, and payment history. This information is crucial in assessing the applicant's creditworthiness and their ability to repay the loan.

    #### Financial Information:
    Financial information provides an overview of the applicant's financial status. It includes data on assets (e.g., property, investments, savings), liabilities (e.g., existing loans, credit card debts), and financial obligations (e.g., monthly expenses, existing loan repayments).

    #### Co-Applicant Information:
    If applicable, this section includes information about co-applicants or co-signers for the loan. It includes their relationship to the primary applicant, their financial information, and their contribution to the loan application.

    #### Approval Status:
    This field indicates whether the loan application was approved or rejected. It provides information on the final decision made by the lender or financial institution based on the evaluation of the applicant's information and risk assessment.

    #### Other Relevant Factors:
    Additional fields may be included to capture any other relevant factors that influence the loan approval process. These may include the loan-to-value ratio, debt-to-income ratio, employment stability, collateral information, and any specific requirements or criteria set by the lender.

    The dataset is typically collected by financial institutions, such as banks or lending agencies, as part of their loan application process. It is important to note that the specific fields and data included in the dataset may vary depending on the institution and the nature of the loans being offered.

    This dataset can be used for various purposes, including building credit risk models, assessing loan eligibility criteria, identifying patterns in loan approval decisions, and developing predictive models to automate the loan approval process.
